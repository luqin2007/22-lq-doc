## ยง Installation

As of now, our most mature client is the Node.js one, which you can easily install from npm:

```
npm install -g tldr
```

There are many more clients that have sprouted from the community, including:

- command-line clients.
- GUI clients for desktop and mobile.
- web-based clients.
- clients which integrate with other applications.

They can be found [in the wiki.](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/wiki/Clients)
